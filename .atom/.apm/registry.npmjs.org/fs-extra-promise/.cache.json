Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise)\n\nAPI is stable. No tests at present but it seems to work fine!\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module is a drop-in replacement for the [native node file system module](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) and the augmented [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fs-extra) module.\n\nAdditionally, it creates promisified versions of all fs's and fs-extra's async methods, using [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bluebird). These methods are named the same as the original fs/fs-extra methods with 'Async' added to the end of the methods.\n\nSo instead of:\n\n\tvar fs = require('fs');\n\tfs.readFile(path, function(err, data) {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t});\n\nYou can now:\n\n\tvar fs = require('fs-extra-promise');\n\tfs.readFileAsync(path).then(function(data) {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t});\n\nAll original fs and fs-extra methods are included unmodified.\n\n### isDirectory() methods\n\nFor convenience, additional methods `isDirectory()`, `isDirectorySync()` and `isDirectoryAsync()` are provided.\n\nThese are are shortcuts for doing `fs.stat()` followed by running `isDirectory()` on the result returned by `stat()`.\n\n## Tests\n\nUse `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.\n\nThere aren't any tests at present, except for running jshint on the code.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee changelog.md\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you discover a bug, please raise an issue on Github. https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/issues\n","maintainers":[{"name":"overlookmotel","email":"theoverlookmotel@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-07T22:51:08.523Z","created":"2014-11-15T10:27:37.970Z","0.0.1":"2014-11-15T10:27:37.970Z","0.1.0":"2014-11-16T17:56:33.938Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-24T23:47:53.679Z","0.1.2":"2015-05-26T09:12:19.687Z","0.1.3":"2015-05-27T08:35:21.069Z","0.2.0":"2015-07-07T22:51:08.523Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise","keywords":["fs","fs-extra","file","promise","bluebird","extend"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise.git"},"author":{"name":"Overlook Motel"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jmelanson-balihoo":true,"monolithed":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"76TP7WPWD9YYCOF6W03P6NQ4P\""}
