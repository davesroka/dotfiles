Node-Salesforce) is a JavaScript Library of Salesforce API, which works both on web browser and Node.js.\n\nIt capsulates the access to various APIs provided by Salesforce in asynchronous JavaScript function calls.\n\nIt also has command line interface (CLI) which gives interactive console (REPL), so you can learn the usage without hassle.\n\nSuported Salesforce APIs are :\n\n- REST API (SOQL, SOSL, describe, etc.)\n- Apex REST\n- Analytics API\n- Bulk API\n- Chatter API\n- Metadata API\n- Streaming API\n- Tooling API\n\n## Document\n\nSee document in http://jsforce.github.io/ .\n\n## Releases\n\nSee [Releases](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/releases).\n\n## License\n\nSee [license](LICENSE) (MIT License).\n\n## Authors\n\n- Shinichi Tomita <shinichi.tomita@gmail.com>\n\n\n## Notes\n\nIf you have any questions, first file it on [issues](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues) before contacting authors via e-mail.\n\nYour contributions are welcome - both by reporting issues on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues) or pull-requesting patches.\n\nIf you want to implement any additinal features to be added to JSforce, which might be or not be merged to our master though, first check current [opening issues](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues?q=is%3Aopen) with milestones to confirm whether the feature is on road map or not.\n\nIf your feature implementation is brand-new or fixing unsupposed bugs in the library's test cases, please include addtional test codes in the `test/` directory.\n\n\n\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues"},"_id":"jsforce@1.3.1","_shasum":"b78c0c0a2a111e5bc2c5bc2d25115d124d8f1e86","_from":"../../../../../../../var/folders/fs/fyt7vwqd14j1yf6lflr3c_6w0000gn/T/npm-24620-50f6e65e/git-cache-6e1ca23562af/32b3f3aeaaea5fab664ffda84b8cd74f36cbfd83","_resolved":"git+https://github.com/joeferraro/jsforce#32b3f3aeaaea5fab664ffda84b8cd74f36cbfd83"}
